- renamed main function to wrapped_main to be able to call it wrapper.cpp (main.c) 
- fixed memory leak for MPI allocated structures in wrapped_main (MPI_Type_free for BabSolutiontype and BabNodetype) (main.c)
- Changed Makefile to provide additional compilation targets for python, added commands for docker and tests
- Added compilation macro PURE_C to compile the original code using only C-lang
- Split original header biqbin.h into biqbin.h, biqbin_cpp_api.h and blas_laplack.h 
- Added wrapper.cpp file where Python.Boost exposed modules are implemented (wrapper.cpp)
- wrapped original runHeuristic and readData to be able to call them with either Python, cpp or original C (heuristic.c, process_input.c)
- added runHeuristic_unpacked which is the original runHeuristc but only using the paramaters it needs (unpacked the Structures)
- Split readData function into two functions: readData and process_adj_matrix (process_input.c)
- Dockerfile added to compile and run biqbin in a container
- added test instances and bash scripts to run tests
