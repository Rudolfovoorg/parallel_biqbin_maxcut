- added Dockerfile
    - removed unnecessary installs
- modified Makefile
    - mkdir command for OBJ to make Obj directory if there isn't one
    - in clean rule to rm command added -rf and $(OBJ)
    - added the docker command
    - added clean-output to clean only the output files
    - added test, test-all commands to run the tests from test.sh
    - added run, run-all commands to run the solver on the g05 instances
    - added test, test-all commands to test the output for all g05 instances

- added test.sh to test the g05 solution on the expected solution
- added unit tests using pytest
- added python wrapper in parallel_biqbin.py wrapper_functions.c to call from python and an example on how to run it in run_example.py
- seperated bounding.c in wrapped_bounding.c so run_heuristics() function can be overriden in ParallelBiqbin class
- seperated run_heuristics wrapped_heuristics.c

- split python wrapper into abstract base class (which contains calls to C and python methods to them) and ParallelBiqbin class which constains the necessary variables and methods to run the solver
- deleted unnused files and functions
- removed main.c and made the solver a shared object instead
