## üîß BiqBin Setup Requirements (Ubuntu 22.04)

### üì¶ System Dependencies (Needs updating):

- `build-essential`
- `libopenblas-dev`
- `mpich`
- `python3`
- `python3-pip`

### üì¶ Python Packages:

- `scipy`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Open the `Makefile`.
2. Set the **compiler** and **BLAS/LAPACK** package paths according to your system.
3. Run:

```bash
make
```

<!-- ### üîß Docker

Dockerfile available for running the solver in a docker container, image can be created using Makefile command

```bash
make docker
```

--- -->

## üöÄ Usage

### Original Biqbin Maxcut Parallel solver - C only

Run with

```bash
mpirun -n num_processess ./biqbin instance_file params
```

- `num_processes`: number of processes to run the program using MPI, program needs at least 2 (1 master, and 1 worker process) to be used.
- `instance_file`: A file containing the graph (in edge list format).
- `params`: The parameter file used to configure the solver.

To run the g05_60.0 instance use this make command

---

### Python Wrapper for Biqbin Maxcut Parallel solver

Can be run with

```bash
mpiexec -n num_processes python3 run_example.py instance_file params
```

- `num_processes`: number of processes to run the program using MPI, program needs at least 2 (1 master, and 1 worker process) to be used.
- `instance_file`: A file containing the graph (in edge list format).
- `params`: The parameter file used to configure the solver.

To run the g05_60.0 instance use this make command

### Examples

Please check the following Python files to find how to setup biqbin solver through Python

- `run_example.py`: Example on how to run the default version of biqbin.
- `run_heuristic_example`: Example on how to inject your own heuristic function into biqbin
- `run_qubo_example`: Example on how to run QUBO instances on biqbin and transform the solution back to a QUBO solution

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** The default **maximum problem size** is **1024 nodes**.  
> If you need more, **edit** the value of `NMAX` in `biqbin.h` and `biqbin_data_objects.py`.
