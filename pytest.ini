# Register custom markers
markers =
    root_bound: Test bounds value of Evaluate() C function on root nodes for all g05_ instances
    seed_tests: Test bounds and solution nodes of Evaluate() C function using different seed values on root nodes

# Additional configurations

# Make sure pytest discovers the tests in the correct location (if needed)
testpaths = ./

# Optimize pytest output for clearer logs
; addopts = 
;     --maxfail=5        # Stop after 5 failed tests (optional, adjust as needed)
    ;  --disable-warnings # Disable warnings (optional, adjust as needed)

# Optional: Set the default Python interpreter for testing
python_files = 
    *_tests.py           # Consider files ending with '_test.py'

# Optional: Configure the number of retries in case of flaky tests
# (Uncomment if you want retries on failing tests)
# retry = 2           # Retry failed tests up to 2 times
